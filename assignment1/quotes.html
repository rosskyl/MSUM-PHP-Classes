			<blockquote>
				My dog doesn't worry about the meaning of life. She may worry if she doesn't get her breakfast, 
				but she doesn't sit around worrying about whether she will get fulfilled or liberated or enlightened. 
				As long as she gets some food and a little affection, her life is fine.
